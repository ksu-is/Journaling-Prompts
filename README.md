This application is an app for people who find it hard to write about anything. Our prompts help people to come up with ideas and address certain issues they haven't put much thought into. 
- Our app when prompted will give the user a couple of different prompt options to get started. Our app will ask what part of their lives they would want to journal about, like career, financials, love, happiness, and family. And based on their answer will give a couple of differnt prompts to get them started. 

After working on my code, I've decided to have my work only have three categories for the prompts and 3 questions for each prompt category.
